# AdvanceLLMAgentLab

## Project Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the UC Berkeley CS 194/294-280 in-class labs focusing on Large Language Model (LLM) agents and Lean theorem proving.

## Background
While participating in the AgentX competition, I became interested in exploring and solving these lab assignments to deepen my understanding of LLM agents and formal verification methods.

## Lab Structure

### Lab 1
The first lab focuses on converting programming problems into Lean formal theorem proving format. The lab involves:
- Parsing input problem descriptions
- Generating Lean theorem definitions
- Creating test cases for verification

### Lab 2
The second lab builds an agent system for generating Lean code. It includes:
- Embedding database for semantic search
- LLM-based code generation
- Test validation framework
- Agent implementation for automated theorem proving

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Lean Theorem Prover
- Large Language Models
- Embedding models for semantic search

## Getting Started
Each lab directory contains its own README and instructions for setup and execution.

## Note
This is a personal implementation for educational purposes related to UC Berkeley's CS 194/294-280 course.
